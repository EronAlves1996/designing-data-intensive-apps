You are absolutely right. My apologies. Let's create a fresh, innovative kata that applies these concepts to a modern business scenario.

### Kata: Concurrent Conference Room Booking System

**Objective:** Identify and resolve a Write Skew anomaly in a collaborative booking system.

**Scenario:**
You are building a conference room booking system for a company's new "Agile Floor." This floor has 5 identical, bookable rooms (R1, R2, R3, R4, R5). The company has a strict policy: **"To prevent overcrowding, a maximum of 3 rooms can be booked for any given 1-hour time slot."**

The system has a `bookings` table:
| id | room_name | time_slot | booked_by |
|----|-----------|--------------------|-----------|
| 1 | R1 | 2023-10-25 14:00 | Alice |
| 2 | R2 | 2023-10-25 14:00 | Bob |
| ...| ... | ... | ... |

Two teams, "Team Alpha" and "Team Beta," both need to book a room for a critical meeting at the same time (**2023-10-25 15:00**). Currently, there are **2** rooms already booked for that slot.

The booking logic for a new request is as follows (run within a transaction with Snapshot Isolation):

1.  **Check Availability:** Count the number of existing bookings for the desired time slot. (`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM bookings WHERE time_slot = '2023-10-25 15:00';`)
2.  **Validate Policy:** If the count is less than 3, proceed. Otherwise, return an "Overcrowding Limit Reached" error to the user.
3.  **Insert Booking:** Create a new booking for a specific, available room. (`INSERT INTO bookings (room_name, time_slot, booked_by) VALUES ('R4', '2023-10-25 15:00', 'Team Alpha');`)

**Your Tasks (30 minutes):**

1.  **The Race Condition:** Describe the precise sequence of operations where both Team Alpha (booking room R4) and Team Beta (booking room R5) can successfully book their rooms, causing the final state to have **4 rooms** booked for the 15:00 slot. Detail the interleaving of the `SELECT` and `INSERT` statements from the two transactions.

2.  **Diagnose the Anomaly:**

    - What is the specific name of this concurrency anomaly?
    - Explain why Snapshot Isolation, which prevents Non-Repeatable Reads, failed to stop this. What is the "phantom" in this scenario?

3.  **Architect the Solution:** Propose two distinct solutions. For each, specify:
    - **a)** The technical implementation (e.g., a specific SQL statement, a locking strategy, or a application-level pattern).
    - **b)** One potential _drawback_ or _consideration_ for this approach in a high-concurrency, real-world booking system.

**Hint:** Focus on the gap between the initial `SELECT` (checking the count) and the final `INSERT` (adding a new row that changes that count). The anomaly is not about updating the same row but about adding new rows that match a previous search condition.
