#‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Ordering Point: Your column order (status, shipping_country, order_date) is good and will work efficiently. A potential alternative worth considering is (shipping_country, status, order_date). If shipping_country has higher cardinality (more unique values) than status, leading with it might filter down the dataset more quickly. However, your choice is perfectly valid and the performance difference would likely be minimal.# 1.

- It's created a B-tree unique index. The clustering of index depends on the database.
- Generally it depends on database. MySQL, as an example, uses clustered index, but postgresql uses non-clustered. For that matter, the fourth query selects all the fields of table by order_id. Because it's critical, I would use a clustered index, seeing that I can take a hit because of write performance.

- **Query 1**: (customer_id, order_date desc) => this would not be a covering index
- **Query 2**: (status, shipping_country, order_date, total_amount) => this gonna be a covering index

### AI COMMENT

‚ùå Incorrect on Covering Index: This is actually a covering index for Query 3! Let's check the query:
sql

SELECT order_id, customer_id, total_amount FROM orders
WHERE status = 'pending'
ORDER BY total_amount DESC;

The index (status, total_amount DESC) contains the status for filtering and the total_amount for sorting. But what about order_id and customer_id?

    In a clustered index (which we chose for the PK), the leaf nodes contain the entire row. So if this is a secondary index, it would likely store the primary key (order_id) as a pointer. This means the index can provide status, total_amount, and order_id. It would then need to do a lookup to get the customer_id.

    However, many databases allow you to INCLUDE columns in an index. If you create the index as (status, total_amount DESC) INCLUDE (customer_id), it becomes a true covering index, storing all required data and requiring zero lookups. Even without the INCLUDE, the performance is excellent because the sort is eliminated.

- What we can do here is to use the following index: (status, total_amount desc). Database gonna filter the values by status and for query 2 will rely on result scan to cover others columns. For query 3, the performance will be the optimal, because the index will be perfect for the query. The query 2 will be more slow for this. We can adapt the index to take more fields for query 2 and discard the total_amount indexing or index only the status column. Indexing only the status column will have the effect on the two queries being slow and suboptimal, so, the business have a choice to make: make results on admin panel slow or the analytics slow.

### AI COMMENT

üí° Alternative Suggestion: Another viable, general-purpose index to consider would be (status, shipping_country). This would still be quite good for Query 3 (it can quickly find all 'pending' orders, though it would still need to sort them by total_amount), and it would be better for Query 2 than an index on status alone. It's a classic "jack of all trades, master of none" compromise.

---

- The index for perfectly covering the query is (status, total_amount desc, customer_id, order_id (maybe?)). The desc clause can be a performance problem because the total_amount is in random order, following the primary key order on the table. To return results, the database have to reorder them accordingly to the order by, taking some time to make this without a proper index

### AI COMMENT

üìù Minor Terminology Point: The total_amount isn't necessarily in "primary key order." It's in the order the rows were found, which is effectively random with respect to total_amount. The key takeaway is the need for a costly in-memory sort (filesort).
